# Geospatial Time Series Analysis
Methods to compute continuous per-pixel raster change from temporally and spatially sparse measurements.

## Installation

Download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  

After installing Miniconda set up [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) (optional but recommended)
```
$ conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```
Clone the repo and set up the conda environment  

```
$ git clone https://github.com/friedrichknuth/gtsa.git
$ cd ./gtsa
$ mamba env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate gtsa
$ pip install -e .
```
## Examples

Each example is accompanied by a jupyter notebook and python script. The notebooks help illustrate the steps performed in the corresponding script.  

### Processing

####  Download historical DEMs for Mount Baker and South Cascade Glacier

- scripts/processing/download_dem_data.py

#### Stack single band rasters and chunk along the time dimension for efficient regression analysis
- notebooks/processing/create_stacks.py
- scripts/processing/create_stacks.py

#### Run memory-efficient time series analysis methods using dask
- notebooks/processing/fit_regression_to_stack.ipynb

### Visualization

####  Downloads historical orthoimages for Mount Baker and South Cascade Glacier
- notebooks/visualization/download_ortho_data.py
- script/visualization/download_ortho_data.py

#### Convert single band rasters to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and send to remote public storage (AWS S3)
- notebooks/visualization/create_cogs.ipynb
- scripts/visualization/create_cogs.py

#### Create interactive folium map for efficient visualization
